### Description

The premise for this app is simple - if you fall over/faceplant/do a random gravity check - you can log in to this app and record it on the map, along with a description of the event. Other clumsy people can see where the tripping hotspots are and avoid them. Users can interact on the site by leaving comments - for example, to wish a fellow user well whilst they recover in hospital.

### Challenges faced

A personal challenge for me was using Jquery to access the data from the trips model in the DOM to plot markers without using server-side.js in the front end. I successfully overcame this in the end with the use of data attribute tags on my maps. 

I struggled with the CSS styling. Whilst in some respects I found it easier using bootstrap, I also found it difficult to position and center things on the page, which often left me frustrated. 
The Node.js and express app back end part I found easier to deal with. 

### Making It Better

Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:

- Improve the overall styling.
- I want to include an address search bar
- I want to include a navigation page - where users can work out a route from point A to point B and see all the potential trip hazards on route.
- I want to hook upto a weather api so on the profile page the app can advise particularly clumsy people not to go out when it is icy.
- add image upload and an oauth from a social media site
- I want to include animations to my app to make the UI seem slicker and more modern.
