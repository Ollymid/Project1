## Trip-Advisor App - slipping into a web-browser near you..

#### Installation and setup

For the optimal installation of this app, you should first do the following:

- Download or clone the repo
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `gulp` to compile the source code and open in browser
- (or alternatively use the new dependency manager Yarn)

> **Note**: You'll need to have `gulp-cli` installed globally
> `npm i -g gulp-cli`

#### A brief description of this App

I love puns, and the idea for this app came from playing around with app ideas using puns of company names that already exist (my back up idea was a site called 'Preesh My Quiche).
The premise for this app is simple - if you fall over/faceplant/do a random gravity check - you can log in to this app and record it on the map, along with a description of the event. Other clumsy people can see where the tripping hotspots are and avoid them. Users can interact on the site by leaving comments - for example, to wish a fellow user well whilst they recover in hospital.


#### Technologies used

You should add a list of the software and languages used in the project, for exmaple:

- HTML 5
- SCSS
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery 3.10
- Gulp
- NPM
- Git & Github

#### Challenges faced

Pardon the pun but one of my major stumbling blocks was accessing the data from the user model in the dom without puting server-side.js into the client-side.js. I successfully managed that in the end with the use of data attribute tags. 
I also battled an old foe which is webpage styling. Whilst in some respects I found it easier using bootstrap to style my app, I also found it difficult to position and center things on the page, which often left me frustrated and dejected. 
The express app part I found easier to deal with. 


#### Final Say
- things to improve for the future

I had so many great ideas where to go with this app, which unfortunately, I was not able to deliver on due to my technical ability 

- Improve the overall styling.
- I want to include an address search bar
- I want to include a navigation page - where users can work out a route from point a to point b and see all the potential trip hazards on route
- I want to hook upto a weather api so the app can advise clumsy people not to go out when it is icy
- add image upload and an oauth from a social media site
- I want to include animation of elements.
